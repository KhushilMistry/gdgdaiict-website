              <div class="collapsible-body"><p>GDG DA-IICT had successfully conducted a  session on GSOC on 11th January,2016.  GSOC is Google Summer of Code, a very prestigious international platform to contribute to open source. It is an international annual program where participants are supposed to complete an open source software coding project and get a stipend for that.

In this session two our team members namely Rishi Shah and Yash Shah, gave a talk on GSOC and a guideline on how to go about it. Rishi Shah from B.Tech 2nd year had got GSOC in 2015 in his first year. Yash Shah, a pass out from B.Tech 2014 Batch had also cracked GSOC in his first year too, has founded a start up called Arreysun and is cofounder at appbase.io .

 They showed the people how to get started with your dream of cracking GSOC so that we end up in a positive scenario. The turn up was very good with around 150 students where the number of boys were considerably greater than that of girls.  The session went smoothly without any technical glitches and all the students seemed to be very pumped up about it at the end of the session.

                <p><b>Event Summary</b><br>
                  This year we at GDG, DA-IICT organized our Devfest, preparations for which had started about a month ago. On the day of the event we started at 9 am with some of the remaining registrations both from our college as well as others while the events started at 10.
                The first session, which lasted an hour, was on the philosophy of material design by Mr. Samir Motwani, Creative Director at RapidOps Solutions. He started off with what material design is and showed various sample websites and apps regarding the same. He talked about how it is fast becoming popular and will soon become the industry standard. He also took a lot of interesting questions from the audience as well as some of the other speakers.

                A lightning talk which started at 11.15 was given next by Ankit Muchhala, a student from DA-IICT who is also a developer at Play Power labs. The talk was on his development stack and also consisted of various tools like Yeoman, Heroku, Egghead.io, Kapeli Dash, npm, Tower etc.

                The next session started at 11.45 and was about Android wireframing, mockups and prototyping conducted by Dhrumil Shah from GDG Ahmedabad. He talked about these stages of creating an app. He stressed upon the importance of first solving a problem and making a blueprint before actually writing the code.

                This session was then succeeded by a lunch break along with a networking session. There was a lot of interaction between the students of the various colleges and the speakers. We had pizzas and people enjoyed a lot. People shared their interests, past projects and talked about themselves in this break.

                After lunch the next session was on Angular JS by Jayesh Anandani, founder of Webelight Solutions. Through an example code he explained the shift from JQuery to Angular. He talked about what two-way data binding is and how it forms the core principle of Angular. The session lasted an hour going up to 2.30 pm.

                The next session was by Dhaval Pandit, marketing head, RapidOps solutions. He talked about the importance of analytics based business strategies when it comes to creating a successful product. He also talked the various tools that they used to collect the relevant data required for the analysis.

                Next was a hangout with Dushyant Jadeja, from GDG Bangalore. His talk was a deep dive into Material UI and Polymer. He in detail explained the advantages of Polymer and showed various examples. He also explained the basics of the Polymer elements.
                We concluded with a very brief lightning talk by Ishit Mehta from Arpanet Marketing Solutions. He talked about his startup and the business aspects of establishing and running a successful venture.

              <div class="collapsible-body"><p>GDG organized a hands-on session on Phonegap on September 28, 2015. The speaker was Lakhan Samani, a member of GDG from the M.Sc. IT 2014 batch. Almost 30 students attended the session. The session saw equal participation from girls and boys. Majority of the attendees were from the M.Sc. IT program. Phonegap is a technology that helps build cross platform mobile applications using only HTML and JavaScript. We faced some issues with network connectivity during the session because of which many participants couldn't code hands-on.
